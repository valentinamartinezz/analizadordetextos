# Text Analyzer.

# Objective:
The main objective of a text analyzer is to process textual information to extract specific knowledge, patterns or characteristics. These analyzers are used in a variety of contexts and have different objectives depending on the purpose for which they were designed.

# How it works:
The program defines functions for various operations on a text string, such as obtaining information, removing spaces, converting to uppercase or lowercase, and replacing a word.
The main_menu function serves as the central control for user interaction, presenting a menu and handling user choices.
Functions like get_information, remove_spaces, show_uppercase_menu, show_lowercase_menu, and replace_word perform specific tasks based on user input.
The program allows users to manipulate a text string in different ways, providing simple text processing tool with a menu-driven interface.

# What it does:
A text analyzer program performs various tasks to process and understand textual information. Specific functions may vary depending on program design and purpose

# Requirements:
sThe code provided is a simple command line program in Python that performs various operations on a text string. To run this code, you need the minimum requirements:

Python:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from python.org. This code appears to be written in Python 3.
Terminal or Console:

You can run this code in a terminal or in a command console.
Development Environment (Optional):

If you prefer, you can also run the code in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as VSCode, PyCharm, or another of your choice.
Once you've installed Python and have a terminal open, follow these steps to run the code:

Save the code in a file with a ".py" extension, for example, "parser.py".
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you save the file.
Let's do everything:
This command will run the program and guide you through an interactive menu where you can perform various operations on a text string.

Remember that apart from the minimum requirements for Python and a terminal, the code has no external dependencies, so no additional libraries are needed to run it.
